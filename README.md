# Traffic-flow-Repo


Traffic flow prediction is a critical aspect of modern urban planning and traffic management. By accurately forecasting traffic conditions, cities can optimize their transportation infrastructure and reduce congestion. This report focuses on the application of time series analysis in Python for traffic flow prediction.

Traffic flow prediction (TFP) means predicting the volume and density of traffic flow, usually to control vehicle movement, reduce traffic jams, and create the optimal (least-time or energy-consuming) route. With the recent advancement in Artificial intelligence, Machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and Big data, research in the field of predicting traffic flow has been expanded extensively.

TFP is the key component of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and can assist ITS to forecast traffic flow. Large cities have exceedingly difficult traffic regulations. many countries have adopted ITS to reduce the costs associated with traffic congestion. 


Finally, we will propose our own predictive model using DL, train and test it, analyze the accuracy and compare the accuracy of our model with other models. Furthermore, In recent years there has been a vast increase in available data with the advancement of smart cities.
